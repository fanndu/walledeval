<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-robot-outline:{ .lg .middle }  __Testing LLM Response Safety__

    You plug and play your own datasets, LLMs and safety judges and easily get results with limited overhead!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Prompt Benchmarking](prompts.md)

-   :material-book-check-outline:{ .lg .middle }  __LLM Knowledge__

    ---

    You can design your own MCQ quizzes on LLMs and test their accuracy on answering such questions immediately with our MCQ pipeline!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: MCQ Benchmarking](mcq.md)

-   :material-gavel:{ .lg .middle }  __Safety Judge Effectiveness__

    ---

    You can easily get messy with testing judges using our extensive framework!

    If you think that's all, you're mistaken! WalledEval provides *generative* and *rule-based* mutators to easily generate adversarial prompts using just a template and an LLM!
