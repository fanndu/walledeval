## üêç Installing from PyPI

Yes, we have published WalledEval on PyPI! To install WalledEval and all its dependencies, the easiest method would be to use `pip` to query PyPI. This should, by default, be present in your Python installation. To, install run the following command in a terminal or Command Prompt / PowerShell:

```bash
$ pip install walledeval
```

Depending on the OS, you might need to use `pip3` instead. If the command is not found, you can choose to use the following command too:

```bash
$ python -m pip install walledeval
```

Here too, `python` or `pip` might be replaced with `py` or `python3` and `pip3` depending on the OS and installation configuration. If you have any issues with this, it is always helpful to consult [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

## üì¶ Installing from Source

To install from source, you will need to undertake the following steps
1. Clone Most Recent Repository Version
2. Install Library Using Poetry

### ‚ö° Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is needed to install this repository. This is not completely necessary as you can also install the zip file for this repository and store it on a local drive manually. To install Git, follow [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

After you have successfully installed Git, you can run the following command in a terminal / Command Prompt etc:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/walledai/walledeval.git
```

This stores a copy in the folder `walledeval`. You can then navigate into it using `cd walledeval`.

### üìñ Poetry

This project can be used easily via a tool known as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). This allows you to easily reflect edits made in the original source code! To install `poetry`, you can also install it using `pip` by typing in the command as follows:

```bash
$ pip install poetry
```

Again, if you have any issues with `pip`, check out [here](#installing-from-pypi).

After this, you can use the following command to install this library:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

This script creates a virtual environment for you to work with this library.

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

You can run the above script to enter a specialized shell to run commands within the virtual environment, including accessing the Python version with all the required dependencies to use WalledEval at its finest!

## üóíÔ∏è Notes during Installation

Some features in our library are NOT ACCESSIBLE via the base dependencies installed in WalledEval. This is due to various dependency mismatches. Here is a list of what is not accessible and how you can use them.

| Feature | Required Dependencies |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| `llm.Llama` | [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) |
| `judge.CodeShieldJudge` | [`codeshield`](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/tree/main/CodeShield), which is by default installed but can only be accessed on a Unix-based OS |
